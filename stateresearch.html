<h1><li><a href = "http://Vermont.gov" target="_new">VERMONT</a></li></h1>
<p>Vermont state website is extremely pleasing to the eye with many picuteres, giving you an visual picture for what you are looking for.
Their website represents Vermont clearly. The website loads fast, almost instant load but not quite. In regards to the menu, it is extremely intuitive, the sub menus corresponding to exactly what you have in mind, when trying to navigate the website for a particular task. You can hover over the menu and the catagories will expand giving all the sub catagories within it making for a quick find.
In terms of being practical, Vermont is easily navigated because it gives you all the information upfront, the first page gives you everything. From living, job searches, online services, exploring the countryside, as well as the info on the fish & wildlife.
The Vermont website also works well in different screen sizes, with the mobile platform having the same setup, allowing for more ease when switching from computer to mobile.
This one is my favorite of the five because everything is easily accessable and the pictures for the catagories makes the website look better as well as make finding things easier because we see pictures a lot faster than just text.

<h1><li><a href = "http://Tennessee.gov" target="_new">TENNESSEE</a></li></h1>
<p>The Tennessee website does well on the looks, many pictures that correspond with a catagory. The website is slower than Vermont but still a comfortable speed.
The menu with submenu dropdowns is nice and organized, not as fun looking but deffinetly more proffessional. easy enough to navigate the menu, though some of the catagories are vaery broad meaning that some digging may be neccessary to find what i am looking for. The regualr items some wouldl be looking for are found easily such as car, driving, employment, licence and permits.
The website works well in different screen size. The website on a mobile device is identical, making platform switches easy because you dont have to find a new way to find something.
All in all, this one is rated second because it is pleasing to the eye with the pcitures that clearly show the intended catagories, as well as giving a lot of information on the first page.

<h1><li><a href = "http://Iowa.gov" target="_new">IOWA</a></li></h1>
<p>The Iowa website is decent on the looks, has a new look with a lot of little symbol icons for each catagory. Website load speed is identical to Tennessee, comfortable. Some nice dropdown menus with color varients which is nice, but uneccessary except staying with the theme.
One thing to note with the menu is that it takes a clik to activate the dropdown versus the previous websites that only required a mouse hover. The website is easily navigated using the menu, with the sub menu clearly stated so you know where to go, if you needed permits or license, or if you were starting a business or healthcare resources.
The first part of the website looks a little empty but once you start scrolling down it quickly fills up with information. The website works with different window sizes. For mobile the website almost seems ot fit better. same layout just with less room for emptyness. This website is cool with its fun facts about Iowa, state bird, flower, Seal etc. 
Also with some nice statistics regarding the states unemployemnt rate, median household income, and highschool graduations be better than the national average.

<h1><li><a href = "http://Alaska.gov"target="_new">ALASKA</a></li></h1>
<p>The Alaska Website looks old, diffinetly an older website or just appears that way. The colors used for the website make it very bland. The website loads fast almost comparable to Vermont.
The menu is displayed with the dropdown sub menu, everything appears in order and I can see the regular items that one would want on a state website. There is a nice menu section for a visitor with all the information needed for a tourists.
The website does not work well in different sizes, the best size is full and if the window is smaller than 75% the screen cuts things out. The mobile version is not well adapted to the mobile platform, actually I dont think it is adapted to mobile at all.
</p>



<h1><li><a href = "http://Oklahoma.gov" target="_new">OKLAHOMA</a></li></h1>
<p>The Oklahoma website looks old and bland. The website loads quickly. Now the menu up front and top is non exsitent.
no menu makes it extremely hard to find what you are looking for. There is a small how do I menu at the bottom with several links listed outright. Not exactly giving the regualar links. 
There is another set of links with the regular menu words but they are stacked and dont look like they would give much info. The first page of the website doesnt give you anythig to work with just some links really. you want to find what your looking for, good luck!
I rank this one as my least favorite, because there is no menu like the others, it's bland, old looking, and hard to navigate.

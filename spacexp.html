	<p>On June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to begin planning for a Space Force: a 6th independent military service branch to 
	undertake missions and operations in the rapidly evolving space domain. The U.S. Space Force would become the first new military service in more than 70 years, 
	following the establishment of the U.S. Air Force in 1947.</p>
	<h2>The Delta Symbol</h2>
	<p>The delta symbol, the central design element in the seal, was first used as early as 1942 by the U.S. Army Air Forces; and was used in early 
	Air Force space organization emblems dating back to 1961. Since then, the delta symbol has been a prominent feature in military 
	space community emblems.</p>
	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p>The USSF is a military service that organizes, trains, and equips space forces in order to protect U.S. and allied interests in space and to 
	provide space capabilities to the joint force. USSF responsibilities include developing military space professionals, acquiring military space systems, 
	maturing the military doctrine for space power, and organizing space forces to present to our Combatant Commands. </p>

<h4>Three Websites Article: Two good, one bad. <a href = "https://cdc.gov" target="_new">CDC</a>, <a href = "https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview" target="_new">ArcGIS Online</a>, and <a href = "https://www.who.int/" target="_new">WHO</a>.</h4>
	<h4><p>I like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for three main reasons. First is that it is spot on in its function, to control and prevent diseases. Everyone is telling us to go to the CDC website for more info on the coronavirus. When we do go to the website, they have setup and updated their website to present everything you need to know on the front page, you cannot miss it. The information is not buried inside. Second, is that it has well thought out pictures to aid in the information that it is representing. Learn more about Coronavirus, they present a picture of the actual virus. Then below that they have pictures that clearly represent the information we people need to know, what are the symptoms, how to care for it in the home, how to disinfect our homes, each one has a corresponding picture to guide our eyes to the information we are seeking. Third reason is the navigation, which is easily understood, the navigation menu is a the top, with the nav menu it is colored blue which makes it stand out to be easily seen but not to a bad effect. Scrolling down it has information about internships and fellowships, which as a student I find very helpful that it is easily found on the first page. The code of the CDC website is modern and clean to my standards, its laid out in columns with no scrolling effect, the layout though makes complete sense and provides everything a consumer wants. Color wise the website is very clever with its white background and using small pieces of color to express their information. All in all, the CDC website is one of my favorite for its simplicity yet cool, and that is provides everything important immediately.</p>
	<p>Next, I like the website for ESRI’s ArcGIS Online application. Also, for three particular reasons. First and foremost is the graphics they use on their website. They have images that represent the ArcGIS online capabilities and tools it provides. They all follow the same theme, a dark purple, black and grey, it really makes the application seem very futuristic, I like the websites that take the effort and make the leap to look beyond these years. Now, I have used ArcGIS online and it truly does have the capabilities that they show, so they still are representing their product truthfully. Second, is the navigation of the information. The website’s setup is clearly understood by someone with limited knowledge of the product and its capabilities, but it is not dumbed down either. They list every on the product on the first page, nothing hidden, there is even videos of how it can help different markets, such as real estate and emergency management. This website also replicates the CDC’s in that the nav menu is a black stripe with the background being white, so that it easily stands out to be more easily found and used. Third and shortly is that they provide a link to launch the product instantly, no download required just click and launch, which makes it easier for their customers and thus better for them. The source page code is clean and extremely organized, makes CDC website look bad, though ArcGIS website does not have to show as much information as the CDC’s website. Even though the website starts with a somewhat boring black and white, scrolling down it quickly goes to a dark theme, making it cool, futuristic and more inviting. One thing that they did that was interesting was that the top ribbon with the launch ArcGIS button was stuck to the top of the screen, so that the launch button was available throughout all pages of the website. For graphics and awesomeness this websites is truly remarkable.</p>
	<p>Now for the website that I don’t particularly like is the World Health Organization (WHO). The first interesting thing I noticed was that in the URL for the WHO website. The domain name instead of being “.com” or “.gov” it was “.int” presumably for international, because the WHO is a international organization. Now I disliked this website for two specific reasons. First, is that it looks like a children’s book and for an international organization that is bad. With its white background it is fills in the space with all these colorful pictures as well as other lighter colors. It appears to me as unprofessional for their function, I believe that are trying to please only one group of customers. The first page is completely just a menu, you must click on something to find the information, it’s certainly organized but could provide more details upfront in my opinion. Second reason is that all the info is buried on different levels, to find something, you may have to go through six different clicks to finally reach your destination, which is inconvenient not to say bad for visitors. Their main menu does stick to the top of the screen when scrolling. They setup their website to be initially to simple, that it cannot provide its primary function of detailed information. The source code is clean and organized and uses a lot of java script more so than the CDC’s and ArcGIS online websites. Most importantly, the WHO website could have been setup to provide more information on the front end then buried behind so many links.
